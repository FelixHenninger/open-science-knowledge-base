# How should I document my research methods in order to make it easier for other researchers to reproduce my work?

**The goal of open protocols is to document and communicate your research methods so that other researchers can easily follow your procedure and replicate your work.**

The term *protocol* refers to the precise method for carrying out or reproducing a given experiment. Depending on your field of study, this includes the exact documentation of procedure, tools, material, software, questionnaires, and variables (optimally along with the [corresponding data]('content/share/open-data/definition/')). This documentation should be provided in an openly accessible (online) repository, to which you link in your paper. This way you can easily give a full overview of your methodology (including everything that did not end up being reported in your paper), making it easier for your fellow researchers, to comprehend and reproduce your procedure.

* The Project Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research developed the [DRESS Protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/dress-protocol/). It is a set of standards for documenting empirical research in the social sciences. It specifies the content and organization of the replication documentation for a study that reports results obtained by manipulating and analyzing statistical data.

* BMJOpen provides an [overview](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/pages/authors/#study_protocols) of items that should be included in a study protocol and lists [reporting guidelines](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/pages/authors/#reporting_guidelines) for various purposes. Though these are mainly aimed at medical research, they might be applicable or transferable to your field.

* The [PRISMA-P checklist](http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/Protocols.aspx) contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol.

* The [SPIRIT Statement](http://www.spirit-statement.org/) provides recommendations for a minimum set of scientific, ethical, and administrative elements that should be addressed in a clinical trial protocol. The Statement also details the scope and systematic development methods of the SPIRIT guidance.

* Unfortunately, journals often don't allow much space to describe your methods in as much detail as it would be necessary to reproduce your experiment. That's where [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) comes to the rescue. This website enable you to create dynamic and interactive protocols, which can even be annotated, discussed and improved. Other researchers may fork and tweak your protocols according to their needs. You can also use this website to collaborate on method development privately.

    If you are awesome enough to  fully  disclose details of data collection and analysis, say so and include the [21-word statement]( https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2160588) in your Methods section.
