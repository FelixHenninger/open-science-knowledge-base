title: Preserving privacy

# How can I preserve participants' privacy?

**Ensuring the anonymity of published data can be a tricky task. We owe it to our participants to guarantee their privacy, while being as transparent about our research as possible.**

* [Meyer (2018)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245917747656) provides _Practical Tips for Ethical Data Sharing_
* [Fraser & Willison (2009)](http://www.ehealthinformation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2009-Tools-for-De-Identification-of-Personal-Health.pdf) present various strategies and _Tools for De-Identification of Personal Health Information_. As examples of more recent implementations of these approaches, [anonymizer](https://github.com/paulhendricks/anonymizer) for `R` obfuscates potentially identifying information, the online tool [Amnesia](https://amnesia.openaire.eu/index.html) shortens identifiers (e.g. postcodes) until they are no longer unique; [Faker](http://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for Python can [generate random, but plausible substitute data](https://www.districtdatalabs.com/a-practical-guide-to-anonymizing-datasets-with-python-faker/).
* The Open Science Framework has defined criteria for a [Protected Access Open Data Badge](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/8. Approved Protected Access Repositories/) and has collected a list of repositories where sensitive data can be stored safely.
* For highly sensitive data, analyses can be made reproducable by publishing raw descriptive data alongside correlation or covariance matrices. For example, [Fried et al. (2017)](https://osf.io/mjd2h/) report a fully open and reproducible analysis based on a publicly available aggregate version of their data.
