!!! danger "Legal note"
    All information are supplied without liability. They only serve as orientation and can by no means replace legal consultation.

It is highly worthy of encouragement if you want to share your data publicly. However, there are a few legal aspects you might want to consider beforehand.

* [Leibniz Universität Hannover & Technische Informationsbibliothek (2018)](https://zenodo.org/record/1173546#.WyEIVKlCRXh) put together some thoughts (in German) on questions like "Is my data protected under copyright and right for utilization?", "Am I allowed to share my data publicly?", "How can I share my data for other researchers to use?", "Which [privacy](privacy/) aspects do I need to consider?" and "Which technical measures I should take?".

* The German Psychological Society also published guidelines for Data Management in Psychological Science [(Schönbrodt, Gollwitzer, Abele-Brehm, 2016)](http://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/documents/Empfehlungen/Data_Management_eng_9.11.16.pdf). Rights and duties of data sharers (and users) can be found  under \#7 (p. 7f). For a summary see [DataWiz](https://datawizkb.leibniz-psychology.org/index.php/after-collection/what-should-i-know-about-data-sharing/).
