# How can I document my methods so that others can reproduce my work more easily?

**The goal of open protocols is to document and communicate your research methods unambiguously, so that other researchers can easily replicate your exact procedures.**

The term *protocol* refers to the precise method for carrying out or reproducing a given experiment. Depending on your field of study, this can include everything from your study setup to the exact procedure you followed when analyzing your data. As with the [data](../open-data/definition), this documentation is best made openly accessible and linked to from your manuscript.

    By including the [**21-word statement**](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2160588) in your methods section, you can make clear that you have reported how the sample size was determined, and all variables and conditions that were included in your study.

## Approaches

Starting from screenshots or a video recording of your study, there are several **informal** methods of documenting your exact procedures.

Beyond these, several institutions have created **formal standards** that provide precise guidance around what should be reported, and how.

* The TIER project has developed the [**DRESS Protocol**](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/dress-protocol/). It is a set of *standards for documenting empirical research in the social sciences* that specify in detail the content and organization a study protocol.

    **Biomedical** researchers in particular have defined a wide range of protocols and standards for different types of research, ranging from human or animal studies to systematic reviews. BMJOpen provides an [overview](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/pages/authors/#study_protocols) of items that should be included in a study protocol, and lists [reporting guidelines](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/pages/authors/#reporting_guidelines) for various purposes. Similarly, the [Equator Network](http://www.equator-network.org/) collects different reporting guidelines, and provides guidance for [selecting the appropriate one](http://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/selecting-the-appropriate-reporting-guideline/).

    For **benchtop experiments**, the website [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) provides a framework to specify exactly how to perform a procedure, and to share and collaboratively extend available protocols.
