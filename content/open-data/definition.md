# What makes open data open?

According to the [Open Definition 2.1](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/), "knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it - subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness".

The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) provide guidelines to make data more **f**indable, **a**ccessible, **i**nteroperable, and **r**eusable.
