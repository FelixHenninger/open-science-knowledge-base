There are tools which you can use to anonymize your data:
* [Amnesia](amnesia.openaire.eu/index.html), an online-tool to remove identifiying information and transform secondary identifiers
* [anonymizer](https://github.com/paulhendricks/anonymizer), an R-package to anonymize data containing personally identifiable information
* Faker, a Python-based approach described by [Benjamin Bengfort](https://www.districtdatalabs.com/a-practical-guide-to-anonymizing-datasets-with-python-faker/)
