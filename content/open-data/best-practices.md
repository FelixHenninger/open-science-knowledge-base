title: Best practices

# What are the best practices around open data?

* [K. Andrew Desoto](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/finding-a-home-for-your-science) addressed a couple of issues concerning _Finding a Home for Your Science_, including DOIs, Online Storages, what kind of data to make available as well as ethical concerns.
* [Goodman et al. (2014)](journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003542) outline _Ten Simple Rules for the Care and Feeding of Scientific Data_
* The [Harvard Biomedical Data Management](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/) group summarize best practices around [security and access](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/security-access), [file naming](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/file-naming-conventions) as well as [versioning](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/versioning-1), with a clear focus on biomedical data.
* [Born-open data](https://doi.org/10.3758%2Fs13428-015-0630-z) is archived publicly directly or very soon after its collection, ideally in an automated way. This practice maximises transparency by obviating the need for on-demand data sharing from the start.
