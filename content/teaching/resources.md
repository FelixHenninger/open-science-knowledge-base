# Where can I find resources for teaching open science?

Open Science is here to stay. Therefore, students deserve to be prepared for a future where reproducable research practices are standard. We have found that students intuitively understand the necessity for changes to the scientific practice, and enjoy applying state-of-the-art methods in their projects.

As with scientific resources, members of the Open Science community have created and share freely their teaching materials. Here are a few resources:

* Many researchers have made their [**course syllabi for open and reproducible methods**](https://osf.io/vkhbt/) openly available.
* The [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](http://improvingpsych.org/) has collected [**teaching and training materials**](https://osf.io/ehpt4/) in general, as well as a collection of [**modular course materials for research methods**](https://osf.io/zbwr4/wiki/home/)
