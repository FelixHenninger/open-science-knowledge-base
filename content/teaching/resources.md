# Where can I find resources for teaching open science?

Open Science is here to stay. Therefore, students deserve to be prepared for a future where reproducable research practices are standard. We have found that students intuitively understand the necessity for changes to the scientific practice, and enjoy applying state-of-the-art methods in their projects.

As with scientific resources, members of the Open Science community have created and share freely their teaching materials. Here are a few resources:

* Many researchers have made their [**course syllabi for open and reproducible methods**](https://osf.io/vkhbt/) openly available.
* The [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](http://improvingpsych.org/) has collected [**teaching and training materials**](https://osf.io/ehpt4/) in general, as well as a collection of [**modular course materials for research methods**](https://osf.io/zbwr4/wiki/home/)


If you want your students to actively engage in replication projects as part of your course, the [Collaborative Replications and Education Project](https://osf.io/wfc6u/wiki/home/) (CREP) provides five studies that are both highly cited and feasible for undergraduates to complete.

[Project Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-classroom) (TIER) develops methods and tools for enhancing research transparency. These can be used by faculty who teach quantitative methods or supervise student research or by students who want to adopt transparent and replicable research practices independetly.
