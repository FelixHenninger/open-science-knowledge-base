# What is Open Access?

Open Access ensures that scientific articles are available [free of charge and other barriers](https://open-access.net/DE-EN/information-on-open-access/open-access-journals). This ensures that fellow researchers as well as the public are able to access scientific ideas and results.

## **Paths** to Open Access

There are two ways or [**strategies to ensure the public availablility of publications**](https://open-access.net/en/information-on-open-access/open-access-strategies/):

* **Gold Open Access** denotes that the published version of an article or book is immediately made openly accessible as part of the publication process.
* For **Green Open Access**, scientific texts are available freely outside of the publication outlets' platform by the author.  This is also known as _self-archiving_ or _self-publishing_.

### **Gold** Open Access

There are several [**business models**](https://open-access.net/en/information-on-open-access/business-models#c831) for providing Gold OA:

* Publishers can levy one-time **Article Processing Charges** (APCs) for providing open access to articles.
* Some journals provide **No-fee Open Access** which is free for authors (sometimes also known as _diamond OA_), largely through institutional funding of journals.

!!! warning "Hybrid models: Per-article OA"

    The gold approach assumes that Open Access is the default for an entire journal rather than an exception on a per-article basis. However, some commercial publishers provide **open access to individual articles**, collecting _both_ APCs and subscription revenue.

    This practice of charging twice is known as **double-dipping**, and while it meets the above definitions in principle, it is controversial because it costs institutions doubly.

###Â **Green** Open Access

For Green OA approaches, the first consideration is _whether_, _when_, and _in which format_, public archival can take place. The main options are:

* A **postprint**, which is identical in content, but not in formatting, to the **published version**, which is typeset by the publisher.
* **Immediate** publishing or archival following an **embargo** period.

The second question is _where_ to archive papers. Again, there are several possibilities:

* **Domain- or field-specific repositories** that gather paper for a certain field.
* **Institutional repositories** that collect material for all scientists at a certain institution.
* A common, though discouraged, practice is to archive papers on **personal homepages**. The difficulty with this approach is that
