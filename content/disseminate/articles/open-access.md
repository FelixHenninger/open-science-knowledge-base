# Open Access Journals and Strategies

What are Open Access Journals?
------------------------------

According to the open-access.net platform, [open access (OA) journals are…](https://open-access.net/DE-EN/information-on-open-access/open-access-journals)

> … online **journals whose articles are accessible free of charge and other barriers immediately upon publication**. As journals that meet this definition do not require authors to transfer copyright to them, the articles are usually released under an open licence granted by the author. At the same time, there are many journals who make their content available for use free of charge but who do not grant open licences. OA journals are the primary medium of the so-called “gold road to open access.”

Different Strategies for Open Access
------------------------------------

### The golden road – primary publication

By the golden road (gold OA) is meant the primary publication of scientific and scholarly works. This may include articles in [OA journals](https://open-access.net/DE-EN/information-on-open-access/open-access-journals/), [OA monographs](https://open-access.net/DE-EN/information-on-open-access/open-access-for-books/), or contributions to openly accessible edited volumes or conference proceedings.

### The green road - self-archiving

By the green road (green OA) is meant parallel publication or self-archiving of scientific and scholarly works on private homepages, institute homepages or document servers.
