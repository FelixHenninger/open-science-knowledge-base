title: Start the Change

# How can I personally implement open science practices?

The amount of information and suggestions you can find when first getting ready to transfer to transparent and reproducible reseach can frankly be overwhelming. Efforts have been made to break all the information down into manageable overviews of [which steps you should take first]().

* The Center for Open Science developed [**Guidelines for Transparency and Openness Promotion** (TOP)](https://osf.io/9f6gx/), which cover eight transparency standards (e.g. Citation Standards, Research Material Transparency, Design and Analysis Transparency or Preregistration). The guidelines are modular so they can be adopted step by step or collectively at once. The guidelines are directed at journals and publishers, but can serve as suggestions for researchers as well.

* Professor Benjamin Le assembled an [**Open Science Manual**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMkTCEFtOq_DB0eoNiyk-B5QCgL6sVSF5pVvD1ONZDc/mobilebasic), providing guidance on how to conduct research within general principles that promote research transparency using the specific open science practices.

* Start using the Open Science Framework! There is fantastic [documentation](https://osf.io/4znzp/wiki/OSF%20for%20Researchers/) on how to make the best use of it for your purposes during any part of the research circle.

* Brian Nosek, Co-founder of the Center for Open Science, made a [**Checklist for Research Workflow**](https://osf.io/mv8pj/wiki/home/) and a [**Research Implementation Checklist**](https://osf.io/mv8pj/wiki/Research%20Implementation/).

* The [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)
 ](https://www.bitss.org/) provides a five-week online course on [**Transparent and Open Social Science Research**](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/open-social-science-research) that covers every step of the research process. Similarly, the [**Open Science MOOC**](https://opensciencemooc.eu/) is developing [course material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KuTSECSYHXZmZX15GDjyD65pJ90eRMhHVEZ-1trsw30/edit#) for learning about Open Science, and has collected many interesting links for different topics that often go beyond scholarly articles.
