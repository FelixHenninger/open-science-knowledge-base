# How can I convince my lab to implement open science practices?

* **Workshops** are often a great way to get your fellow researchers in touch with new methods.
** If you are up to it yourself, you might find inspiration in the [Open Science Workshop Materials of the LMU Open Science Center](https://osf.io/zjrhu/).
** The COS provides an Open and Reproducible Research Trainer Space which contains a vast body of material for Open Science workshops including sections on workshop planning (pre workshop checklists, flyers, email tempates, etc.) and curriculum (slides, full manual).
** Or get in touch with one of the speakers on [this list](https://osf.io/tbkzh/wiki/Speakers%20for%20talks%20and%20workshops%20on%20Open%20Science%20topics/), who cover several topics in the field of Open Science.
* If you're in one of those labs, where people are indifferent about replicability or even openly take a stand against it, you might find some arguments for your next discussion in one of these resources:
** [Zwaan, R., Etz, A., Lucas, R. E., & Donnellan, B. (2018, August 1). Making Replication Mainstream.](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4tg9c)

# What should I think of, when I want to transition my lab to open science practices?

We think it's totally legitimate to move in small steps. Research is a continuous process, so you can try to implement new practices along the way. (To make that a bit easier, we tried to structure this ressource based on the scientific circle.)

* Some people at the SIPS Meeting 2018 put together some [links to useful resources](https://osf.io/f529n/wiki/home/ ) for transitioning to open science practices in labs.
