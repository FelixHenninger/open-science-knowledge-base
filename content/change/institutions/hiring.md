title: Hiring process

# How can open source practices be promoted in the hiring process?

* Felix Sch√∂nbrodt is collecting [**academic job offers that mentioned open science**](https://osf.io/7jbnt/). His department has instituted a hiring policy that [asks for plans and previous experience around transparent research](http://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-policy-lmu/).
* There is an ongoing initiative to [**define and certify open research practices**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ty43Syw0Flkh8ncjW8MZArIkvYe8hLwwhLlIwbtSk_Y/edit) so that the individual or institutional level of experience with these practices can be assessed.
