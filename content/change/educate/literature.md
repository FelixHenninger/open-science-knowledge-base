title: Introduction

After more than half a decade of discussion, the literature on reproducible science is substantial. Thankfully, brave authors have provided summaries and reviews. If you're looking for a place to get started, search no more, we've got you covered!


# What started the Open Science Movement in the first place and why is it so important?

* [Nelson, J. Simmons, & Simonsohn \(2017\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011836) have written an excellent overview of **Psychology's Renaissance**, with a focus on questionable research practices and suggested mitigation strategies.

* [Spellman, Gilbert, & Corker \(2017\)](https://psyarxiv.com/ak6jr) provide practical, actionable advice for **Open Science: What, Why, and How**


# Where can I learn more?

Did we get you hooked? Great!

* Brent Roberts and Dan Simmons have compiled an extensive [**Reproducibility and Replicability Reading List**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14lBD0aZDPij2Z6AOpAharOAtmt6ZBI0EuF3_tu8m66I/) which lists further literature by topic.

    At times you might find yourself lost with a bunch of new terms you have never encountered before. No worries, others have been there, too, which is exactly why Jon Tennant and Ross Mounce compiled the (Open Science Glossary)[http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1482094].
