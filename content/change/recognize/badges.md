#Â How do the Open Science Badges work?

**The [Open Science Badges](https://osf.io/tvyxz/) are simple visual indicators that a publication or project followed open practices.** [Kidwell et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002456) describe the badges and their underlying motivation, and show that the rate of openly archived data increased dramatically after their introduction at _Psychological Science_, as did the proportion of openly available materials.

The badges indicate [**preregistration**](../../plan/preregistration/why.md) of a project's design and analysis, the presence of [**open data**](../../share/open-data/definition.md) and the **open availability of materials**. There is also a [**protected access open data**](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/8.%20Approved%20Protected%20Access%20Repositories/) badge for critical data that is placed in a repository, yet are only accessible following a standardized authorization procedure. [**Preregistration plus**](https://osf.io/6q7nm/) indicates the presence of an analysis plan that corresponds directly to the reported analysis.

    * Every badge comes with a [set of **criteria**](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/1.%20View%20the%20Badges/) that govern whether it can be conferred.
    * The Open Science Framework maintains a [list of **journals that offer badges**](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/5.%20Adoptions%20and%20Endorsements/).
