# Which projects is the community working on?

* The [**Psychological Science Accelerator**](https://psysciacc.org/) organizes distributed large-scale data collection projects worldwide. It is open to everyone, and its members are positively prolific!
* [**Study Swap**](https://osf.io/9aj5g/) is an online platform to support collaborative research (with a focus on psychology). It is designed to facilitate any type of exchange, such as requesting or sharing resources and finding collaborators. The project provides a brief [step-by-step guide](https://twitter.com/Study_Swap/status/1016501689959047168) and a [tutorial paper](https://psyarxiv.com/wqhbj/) that describe the process.
* The [**ManyLab Project**](https://osf.io/89vqh/) is another of the first collaborative research projects. Its goals are to specifically investigate questions that require a grand scale of inter-lab collaboration:
    * [Heterogenity of replication results](https://osf.io/ebmf8/) across samples and settings (there is also a similar [follow-up project](https://osf.io/8cd4r/) that is not yet published)
    * [Data quality in participant pools across the semester](https://osf.io/csygd/)
    * [Effects of expert-led vs in-house study design](https://osf.io/8ccnw/) on replication success
    * [Effects of pre-data-collection peer-review](https://osf.io/7a6rd/) on replicability

!!! question
    **There's probably a lot we are missing!** Can you help provide further information?
