# How can I find out what's going on in the open science world?

The Open Science Movement is still pretty young and we're far from a point, where open practices are a given. So at times it might feel like you're the only one around caring about those issues. But don't fret, you are, in fact, not alone at all!

**The Open Science community is a vibrant, friendly and collaborative group** of people working together to improve psychological science. Many discussions take place in the open, and there is always a lot going on. How can we keep up with the latest developments?

There are [local initiatives and global organizations]('change/community/offline_community.md') that have made it their mission to foster open science. If there is no such initiative at your university yet, maybe you have the capacities to [start one('change/institutions/uni.md')]? Otherwise, you can always turn to [social media]('change/community/contact.md') and find your allies there! And finally, you might want to join one of these cool [collaborative projects]('change/community/collaboration.md').
