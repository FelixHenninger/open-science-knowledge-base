# Social media

* [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/) provides a never-ending firehose of discussions. The [@OpenScience](https://twitter.com/openscience) account often collects news and articles regarding Open Science across disciplines; the organizations below are also represented. If you follow some voices you find interesting, you'll likely soon get a feeling for ongoing discussions.
* [**Facebook**](https://facebook.com/) also hosts some forums related to open science, though less so. An active group in the realm of methodology and statistics is [PsychMAP](https://www.facebook.com/groups/psychmap/about/).
* **Blogs** reflect individual opinions in a longer format. You might enjoy the [100% CI](http://www.the100.ci/), Simine Vazire's [Sometimes I'm Wrong](http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/) or [Felix Sch√∂nbrodt's blog](http://www.nicebread.de/)?
* **Podcasts** can be great for casual listening to discussions. Examples you might find interesting are the [Open Science Radio](http://www.openscienceradio.org/category/english-episodes/) or [The Black Goat](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com). Sau-Chin Chen put together an [overview of Psychological Science Podcasts](http://scchen.com/en/post/ps-podcasts/), which are mostly hosted by Open Science Promoters.

    Academic social media is great at giving voice to a wide and diverse group of people, but dealing with the deluge of information can be exhausting. It's hard if not impossible to keep up, and everybody seems to be working so hard and achieving so much! As much as the banter can be uplifting, it can at times be depressing.

    * The members of the podcast [The Black Goat](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com), themselves veteran prolific tweeps, discuss the [**blooming, buzzing confusion**](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com/posts/a-blooming-buzzing-confusion/) that is social media.
    * Dorothy Bishop lays out [**a simple rule to reduce stress**](https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2018/05/how-to-survive-on-twitter-simple-rule.html) caused by unpleasant and negative messages.
