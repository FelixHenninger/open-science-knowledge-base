# Organizations

There are several organizations that have made it their mission to foster open science, especially in the field of psychology:

* The [**Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science**](http://improvingpsych.org/) \(SIPS\) is a grass-roots initiative to improve research practices on both an individual \(through training and outreach\) and institutional level. SIPS organize an [annual meeting](http://improvingpsych.org/meetings/) which focusses on collaboration in the service of open science.
* The [**Center for Open Science**](https://cos.io/) runs the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and provides several related services around [preprints](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-preprints/), [open conference materials](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-meetings/), and similar efforts. The COS is represented through a worldwide network of [ambassadors](https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/).

# Local initiatives
Besides larger organisations, there are several local, university-level initiatives. The German network of open-science initiatives (NOSI) maintains a [list of local working groups](https://osf.io/tbkzh/wiki/home/) in Germany and beyond. Maybe there is one at your university that you can join? If not, you might want to consider [starting one](change/institutions/uni.md) yourself!

<!-- Or maybe you can start your own! -->
<!-- Convince your lab -->
