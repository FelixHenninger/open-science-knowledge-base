    Hi Felix, dear team,

    I really enjoyed the Open Science Knowledge Base, and I think you
    could make it even better by adding a page on [ topic ]. This would
    extend the section [ section ], and a good question header would be
    [ question? ]. Would you consider adding a page like this?

    I understand that we're all super-busy and working hard, so feel
