# Which projects is the community working on?

* The [**Psychological Science Accelerator**](https://psysciacc.org/) organizes distributed large-scale data collection projects worldwide. It is open to everyone, and its members are positively prolific!

* [**Study Swap**](https://osf.io/9aj5g/) is an online platform to support collaborative research. You can use it for any type of exchange that you can think of, e.g. find collaborators, ask for resources or offer resources to fellow researchers. At the moment it is mostly populated by Psychologists, but it is open to all fields.

* The [**ManyLab Project**](https://osf.io/89vqh/) intends to connect researchers for collaborative research projects. If you are looking to recruit collaborators or would like to join a project, this might be for you. It seems like there hasn't been much going on lately, so why not help reactivate it?
