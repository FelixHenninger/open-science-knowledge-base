# Which projects is the community working on?

* The [**Psychological Science Accelerator**](https://psysciacc.org/) organizes distributed large-scale data collection projects worldwide. It is open to everyone, and its members are positively prolific!
* [**Study Swap**](https://osf.io/9aj5g/) is an online platform to support collaborative research. You can use it to initiate any type of exchange that you can think of, e.g. find collaborators, ask for resources or offer resources to fellow researchers. At the time of writing it is mostly populated by psychologists, but it is open to scientists of all fields.
* The [**ManyLab Project**](https://osf.io/89vqh/) is another of the first collaborative research projects. Its goals are to specifically investigate questions that require a grand scale of inter-lab collaboration:
    * [Heterogenity of replication results](https://osf.io/ebmf8/) across samples and settings (there is also a similar [follow-up project](https://osf.io/8cd4r/) that is not yet published)
    * [Data quality in participant pools across the semester](https://osf.io/csygd/)
    * [Effects of expert-led vs in-house study design](https://osf.io/8ccnw/) on replication success
    * [Effects of pre-data-collection peer-review](https://osf.io/7a6rd/) on replicability

!!! question
    **There's probably a lot we are missing!** Can you help provide further information?
