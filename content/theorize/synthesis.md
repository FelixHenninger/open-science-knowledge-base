# How can I keep track of the reliability of results?

As the replication crisis casts doubt on the reliability of research findings, and replications become more common, **we might need to reevaluate our confidence in published results more often** -- in either direction. **How can we keep up-to-date?**

##Â Summarizing replication efforts

* [**Curate science**](http://curatescience.org/) collects replications and registered reports and matches them to the original articles. The service aggregates and visualizes effect sizes of the original study and its replications, and computes a meta-analytic average.
* [**PsychFileDrawer**](http://psychfiledrawer.org) archives attempted replications of specific studies and whether the replication was achieved, making it easier to estimate the robustness of an effect or finding resources for meta-analyses.

## Collecting errata and retractions

* [**Open Retractions**](http://openretractions.com/) tracks the status of every article indexed on PubMed and CrossRef: Whether it was retracted, and whether errata are available. The [retractcheck](https://github.com/libscie/retractcheck) package for `R` automates this process.
* The blog [**Retraction Watch**](https://retractionwatch.com/) maintains an ongoing collection and commentary on retracted papers, with a (non-exclusive) focus on biomedical research.
