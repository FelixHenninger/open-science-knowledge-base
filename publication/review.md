Reviewers provide quality control and a seal of approval for the published scientific literature. They have considerable influence over what gets published, and can use this leverage to encourage more open practices.

* If you would like to commit to requiring open practices in the papers you review, you could consider joining the [**Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative**](https://opennessinitiative.org/). Members of the PRO pledge to require open data and materials, or an explanation why either is not possible, before reviewing a paper.
