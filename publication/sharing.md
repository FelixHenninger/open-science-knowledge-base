The degree to and the format in which you can (legally) share your papers openly, for example by uploading `pdf` files to your personal homepage or any public repository, depends on your agreement with the publisher.

The [Sherpa/Romeo database](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) catalogues policies by journal for many publishers.

If a publisher asks for a transfer of copyrights during the publication process, you may be able to negotiate a more favorable agreement. The [SPARC Author Addendum](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights) provides a template that (among other things) allows the author to disseminate a typeset version of the article for non-commercial purposes.
