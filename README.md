Welcome to the **open science knowledge base**! This is an annotated collection of practical resources for researchers interested in using open practices in their work.

This guide was initially built as an annotated list of links for the [psychology department](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau/fb8) at the [University of Koblenz-Landau](https://uni-koblenz-landau.de), but we hope it finds use far beyond it. Please feel free to fork and extend this guide!
