Welcome to **practical open science**! This is an annotated collection of resources for researchers interested in incorporating open practices into their work.

This guide was initially built as an annotated list of links for the [psychology department](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau/fb8) at the [University of Koblenz-Landau](https://uni-koblenz-landau.de), but we hope it finds use far beyond it. Please feel free to fork and extend this guide!
