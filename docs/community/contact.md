# How can I find out what's going on in the open science world?

**The Open Science community is a vibrant, friendly and collaborative group** of people working together to improve psychological science. Many discussions take place in the open, and there is always a lot going on. How can we keep up with the latest developments?

## Social media

Much of the day-to-day chatter can be found on social media:

* [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/) provides a never-ending firehose of discussions. The [@OpenScience](https://twitter.com/openscience) account often collects news and articles regarding Open Science across disciplines; the organizations below are also represented. If you follow some voices you find interesting, you'll likely soon get a feeling for ongoing discussions.
* [**Facebook**](https://facebook.com/) also hosts some forums related to open science, though less so. An active group in the realm of methodology and statistics is [PsychMAP](https://www.facebook.com/groups/psychmap/about/).
* **Blogs** reflect individual opinions in a longer format. You might enjoy the [100% CI](http://www.the100.ci/), or [Simine Vazire](http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/)?

## Organizations

There are several organizations that have made it their mission to foster open science, especially in the field of psychology:

* The [**Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science**](http://improvingpsych.org/) \(SIPS\) is a grass-roots initiative to improve research practices on both an individual \(through training and outreach\) and institutional level. SIPS organize an [annual meeting](http://improvingpsych.org/meetings/) which focusses on collaboration in the service of open science.
* The [**Center for Open Science**](https://cos.io/) runs the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and provides several related services around [preprints](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-preprints/), [open conference materials](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-meetings/), and similar efforts. The COS is represented through a worldwide network of [ambassadors](https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/).
