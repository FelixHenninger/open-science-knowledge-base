After more than half a decade of discussion, the literature on reproducibility is substantial. Thankfully, brave authors have provided summaries and reviews:

* [Spellman, Gilbert, & Corker \(2017\)](https://psyarxiv.com/ak6jr) provide practical, actionable advice for **Open Science: What, Why, and How**
* [Nelson, J. Simmons, & Simonsohn \(2017\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011836) have written an excellent overview of **Psychology's Renaissance**, with a focus on questionable research practices and suggested mitigation strategies.
* Brent Roberts and Dan Simmons have compiled an extensive [**Reproducibility and Replicability Reading List**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14lBD0aZDPij2Z6AOpAharOAtmt6ZBI0EuF3_tu8m66I/) which lists further literature by topic.
* The [**Open Science MOOC**](https://opensciencemooc.eu/) is developing [course material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KuTSECSYHXZmZX15GDjyD65pJ90eRMhHVEZ-1trsw30/edit#) for learning about Open Science, and has collected many interesting links for different topics that often go beyond scholarly articles.
