# How do registered reports work?

**Registered reports** are a form of publication where the preregistration is peer-reviewed before data is collected, and the decision to publish is made regardless of the study's outcome.

* The [registered reports page at the Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/rr/) provides an excellent collection of resources, including participating journals, practical information for all parties involved, and answers to common questions.
* [Chambers, Feredoes, Muthukumaraswamy and Etchells \(2014\)](/ https://dx.doi.org/10.3934/ Neuroscience2014 .1. 4 ) introduce registered reports, outline the underlying motivations, and respond to common objections.
* [Greve, Br√∂der, and Erdfelder \(2013\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1016-9040/a000144) suggest a similar idea, _result-blind peer review_.
