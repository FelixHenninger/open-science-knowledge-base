# What is a preprint, and why should I publish one?

According to Wikipedia, a [preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) is

> **[...] a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal.** The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.

A preprint makes a manuscript widely available independently of its formal publication. This provides greater and earlier exposure compared to the traditional route, which has advantages and downsides.

* Nikolaus Kriegskorte lists [**selfish reasons for preprint posting**](https://thewinnower.com/papers/3674-the-selfish-scientist-s-guide-to-preprint-posting) and discusses the importance of timing.
* In fields with a long tradition of preprints like physics, availability of preprints appears to result in a [fairly large](http://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11192-007-1661-8) [boost](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-006-0262-7) [in citations](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411275v1), though it is difficult to establish causality and results might not generalize to other subjects. More careful randomized controlled trials suggest that [open-access publishing certainly increases exposure, but does not translate to added citations](http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a568.full).
