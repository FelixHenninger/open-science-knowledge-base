title: Changing plans

# Can I change my plans after preregistration?

**Yes!** It's not realistic to demand that researchers anticipate every little decision upfront. However, we should be transparent about the changes we make (that's what the preregistration is about). As an article on the Open Science Framework notes, preregistration is [a plan, not a prison](https://cos.io/blog/preregistration-plan-not-prison/); it also provides practical guidance for different stages of research.
