title: Preprint servers

# Where can I find or publish preprints?

Though a preprint could be circulated through any medium in principle, in practice, fields often establish central repositories that disseminate manuscripts further, for example by notifying interested community members, and screening uploaded content. There are several such repositories or _preprint servers_.

To benefit best from the additional exposure a preprint gains, you'll probably want to choose a location based on where your manuscript will find the largest number of interested readers. For psychology, the [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](http://improvingpsych.org/) has established [**PsyArXiv**](https://psyarxiv.com/), which has since been named the [APA's preferred preprint service](http://blog.psyarxiv.com/2017/08/14/apa-names-psyarxiv-preferred-preprint-service/).

Other fields have a long tradition of preprint publication and established central repositories, especially [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) for physics, mathematics, and computer science. Because preprint submission is so common in these areas, some journals allow for submissions directly through arXiv. The [Open Science Framework]() provides a [domain-general service for preprint repositories](https://osf.io/preprints), which powers a number of preprint repositories.
