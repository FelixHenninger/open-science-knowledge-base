**By preregistering research, you create a public record of your hypotheses and planned analyses before you conduct them**, so that you can later demonstrate that you did not change hypotheses after learning your results \(HARKing; [Kerr, 1998](https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4)\), nor that changed the analysis to create a specific result. This further increases the credibility of your findings.

## Questionable research practices

Preregistration is all about proving that we don't engage in questionable research practices \(QRPs\).

* [Nuzzo \(2015\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/526182a) highlights the potential for self-deception in research, and summarizes countermeasures \(preregistration being one of them\)
* [Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, van der Mass, and Kievit \(2012\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691612463078) list the different biases that can be introduced into an analysis, and argue that only pre-registered research should be labelled 'confirmatory'.
* [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn \(2011\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632) demonstrate how flexibility in the analysis inflates the false positive rate by demonstrating that listening to "When I'm sixty-four" by the Beatles rejuvenates participants.
* [John, Loewenstein, and Prelec \(2012\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797611430953) estimate the prevalence of _questionable research practices_ such as the above. [Fiedler and Schwarz \(2016\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550615612150) argue that their estimates were inflated and that the issue is less widespread.

## Preregistration as a solution

* [van’t Veer and Giner-Sorolla \(2016\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2016.03.004) provide an excellent overview over the motivation for and history of preregistration in psychology and medicine, discuss advantages, objections, and limitations, and provide practical guidance with a focus on social psychology.

* In an open letter, Chambers, Munafo and over 80 signatories argue that [trust in science would be improved by study pre-registration](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/jun/05/trust-in-science-study-pre-registration) \(2013\).

## Registered reports

**Registered reports** are a form of publication where the preregistration is peer-reviewed before data is collected, and the decision to publish is made regardless of the study's outcome.

* The [registered reports page at the Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/rr/) provides an excellent collection of resources, including participating journals, practical information for all parties involved, and answers to common questions.
* [Chambers, Feredoes, Muthukumaraswamy and Etchells \(2014\)](/ https://dx.doi.org/10.3934/ Neuroscience2014 .1. 4 ) introduce registered reports, outline the underlying motivations, and respond to common objections. 
* [Greve, Bröder, and Erdfelder \(2013\)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1016-9040/a000144) suggest a similar idea, _result-blind peer review_.
